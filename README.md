# VTCManager-Client

VTCManager is a powerful job logger for the [Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2)](https://eurotrucksimulator2.de/) and [American Truck Simulator (ATS)](https://americantrucksimulator.com/) by [SCS Software](https://scssoft.com/). It expands the gaming experience of ETS2 and ATS. In addition to the normal logging of orders for Virtual Trucking Companies (VTC), the software adds many other functions such as a convoy assistant, support for external electronic components (displays, microcomputers such as Raspberry Pi or Arduino for external speedometers, dashboards, and buttons) and much more.

## Project Status
The latest version of the VTCManager is currently in public beta. The basic functions are functional, but may still contain errors. In addition, many other functions are missing that should be implemented by the first stable release.
